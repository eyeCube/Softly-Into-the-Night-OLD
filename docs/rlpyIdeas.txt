	TRACK: HOW MANY THINGS WITH STATUS EFFECTS ARE THERE?
		after something burns to death, it should be removed from the game entirely, including being removed from all lists like the status effect list.
	FIRE REMOVAL HAPPENING TOO OFTEN
	CORPSES BURNING TO DEATH INDEFINITELY
		ASHES NOT GETTING CREATED
	FIRE LIGHTS SHOULD SHINE AT END OF TURN, UNSHINE ONLY IF NECESSARY
	FIRE SHOULD NOT DIE AND REGEN EVERY GAME TURN, THIS WILL SLOW DOWN THE GAME A LOT.
	SET_FIRE GETTING CALLED TOO OFTEN
	GAME_UPDATE GETTING CALLED TOO OFTEN
	IN_RANGE GETTING CALLED A LOT
	maybe we shouldn't sleep so much? Or try wait instead of check for input?
	refresh
	
	
	
Todo:
	level generation
	eating + corpse eating
	status effects - fire, bio to start
		fire tiles separate from burning status effect
	skills
	implement delayed actions ( immediate actions vs. )
	town w/ shops
	saving (use pickle)
		save everything in game into ONE object, then serialize that object.
		deserialize to load.
		https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/bd7oh5/memory_usage_for_large_maps/
	improve speed
		https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/bhrmnr/how_to_make_game_less_laggy/
	implants, robotic limbs
	improve sounds - enemy hearing, reacting to sense events
		sound of fire burning should only play when wood is burning
		sound of fire should also be much quieter
	aiming - similar to Sea of Green implementation
	alert: can hear fire through walls
	body swapping (controlling other entities)
		change pc pointer to the object you want to control. Should be easy.
	materials affect properties of objects
	overhaul fire system: mix tilemap's grid_fires with fire manager
		- make fires not thing-based but tile-based entities.
		Status manager handles fire DOT
		fire spreads when you move
	checker the tiles in the grid, add random noise to color
	Things drop their inventory when they die
	terminals
	companions
	different AI for each creature type
	Brogue-style UI with sidebar showing things in view, things you can hear, etc.
	things get bloody during combat
	holes that you can fall through
	dark areas which are barely lit up are colored blue-ish
	when in water:
		vision affected
		lose items
		items in inventory get wet / rust
	weapons
	robotics
		drone bots, swarm bots, nanobots
		robots / androids / AI systems
		cyborgs
	railguns mounted guns
	add_listener_sounds for monsters who can hear
	make game exportable on as many platforms as possible
		https://benob.itch.io/expelledrl 
		this game is python tcod and exportable.
	sounds should be visible as a colored musical note on the map.
		what you see, hear, feel, smell, taste should only give a message if necessary to express to the player what's happening. Separate senses?
	only update fov if:
		thing moved
		tilemap updated opacity of one or more tiles
	mutations - have pros and cons
		chargen allows you to select genetic mutations
	overencumberance, volume???

Fire behavior
	Check for dying conditions:
		Each turn there's a chance to die depending on the fuel (or lack thereof) available in that tile.
		If the tile of the fire is shallows or water or deepwater, then the fire goes out. If it's a puddle, the puddle turns into steam and the fire dies.
	Each turn there's a chance to leap to an adjacent tile, adding a new fire at that spot.
	When something on fire moves, the tile it moves to catches fire.
	When something is on fire, everything in its inventory takes burn damage too.
	
Electricty status
	idea: add an electric meter
		when full, you get paralyzed
	
	
	
Material of object influences several things about it. Rather than having dozens of describing variables about the object's physics, it just has one variable: material. Examples of how material affects its interactivity:
	brittleness - likelihood to shatter when killed
	malleability - tendency to lose its shape when struck
	bounciness - tendency to bounce when striking a surface
	reflectiveness - ability to reflect lasers
	transparency - ability for light/LOS to pass through
	flammability - brightness / intensity of the flame it produces
	friction - tendency to slow when sliding across surfaces
	density - affects settling point when suspended in fluid
	
	
Hazards (bio, chem, radiation) stick around for a long time.
Fires are shorter lasting.
Brightness of fires based on the material of the fuel.
	wood burns bright gold, red, yellow
	flesh does not burn brightly, burns red
	cloth burns medium brightness
	oil burns medium, burns green
	tar burns bright, burns gold
	fungus burns dimly blue
levels.py could contain code for generating floors based on their depth
	uses proc. gen. functions from TileMap

	
TYPES OF DAMAGE:

Physical damage:
	deals Lo chi damage

FIRE damage:
	FIRE resist
	causes TEMP meter to raise.
	When TEMP meter full, you catch FIRE, and TEMP meter stays maxed out for the duration of the status.
	FIRE status:
		damage over time to Lo chi
		fire spreads to other flammable things
		can be put out with water

HAZARD damage:
	Inflicts a HAZARD status.
	All HAZARD damage types are resisted by HAZARD resist.
	BIO damage:
		Causes IMMUNITY meter to raise (depending on your resistance).
		When IMMUNITY meter full, you become ill, and meter stays maxed out for the duration of the status.
		ILL status:
			slow damage over time to Lo and Hi chi
			chance to vomit
			no appetite - cannot eat
	CHEM damage:
		Causes instantaneous effect if not resisted.
			effects short-lived compared to bio effects
		Causes Lo damage over time.
		causes EXPOSURE meter to raise (depending on your resistance).
		When EXPOSURE meter full, you die.
		causes a random one of the following statuses:
			irritation
			paralysis (if airborne)
			blindness (if airborne)
			uncontrollable coughing (if airborne)
			uncontrollable vomiting (if airborne)
	RAD damage:
		Exposure causes RAD meter to increase (depending on your resistance)
		When RAD bar is full, causes mutation, then RAD bar is reset.
			mutation causes a permanent change in the creature
			also permanently lowers maximum Hi chi by 1
	
ELECTRIC damage:
	ELEC resist
	instantaneous effect
	causes instant damage to Hi chi
	damage Lo chi if damage is high enough
		(more damage => more Lo damage)
		LoDamage = int((ELEC damage - resist) / 25)
	causes paralysis if damage is higher
	causes knockback if damage is REALLY high
	causes instant death if (ELECTRIC damage - ELEC resist) >= 100
	
Resistances:
	FIRE
	HAZARD
	ELEC
	
	
Meters:
	FIRE 								(temperature?)
		FIRE damage raises this meter
	BIO 								(immunity, sick?)
		BIO damage raises this meter
	CHEM 								(exposure?)
		CHEM damage raises this meter
	RADS
		RAD damage raises this meter

			These classes only influence your starting conditions. Any character can gain any of these abilities and more. However, it may be difficult and costly to acquire them. To learn a new skill takes a lot of time, so it is impractical to learn in the traditional sense; instead you must pay to have the skills implanted in your brain.

	Hunger loss rate:
		1 per turn
		50 per attack
		5 per move (25 if sprinting)
	Hunger stages
		Hunger: 50,000 maximum
		full		95%+
		satiated	90%+
		nourished	85%+
		hungry		75%+
		starving	50%+
		famished	25%+
		emaciated	<25%
		dead		0
	Multiply Food units Factor: 250
		(all food items recover hunger units equal to their food units * 250)


Stats:
	Lo qi
		costs Lo qi to attack with heavy weapons
		some enemies deal Lo qi damage
	Hi qi
		costs Hi qi to attack with tech weapons
		some enemies deal Hi qi damage
	AP (Action Points)
		Potential to perform actions; all actions require Action Points to perform and when you run out, your turn ends.
	speed
		how many Action Points you gain per turn
		only increases in rare cases like if you take moon sugar
	attack spd	
		With increased attack speed, attacking becomes more efficient, reducing the number of Action Points required to attack.
		modified by weapons
	move spd
		With increased move speed, moving becomes more efficient, reducing the number of Action Points required to move.
		modified by equipment
	attack
		increases chance to hit foes
		There is no limit to how much Attack you can have, and your chance to hit continues increasing with each additional point in Attack (with diminishing returns).
		It is very important to have a decent Attack value in order to ensure you can successfully hit foes, as it is possible to have only a 5% chance to hit if your foe has 19 more DV than you have Attack.
		It is impossible to have lower than a 5% chance to hit.
	power
		increases damage
	DV
		Dodge Value
		Increases chance to dodge foes' attacks. With negative DV, your foes have a greater chance to hit you. However, increasing DV has little effect until you gain a lot of it, at which point it becomes more and more effective. If (your opponent's Attack - your DV) <= 1 then your opponent has only a 5% chance to hit.
	AV (Armor Value)
	ResBIO (Resist BIO-type damage)
	ResFIR (Resist FIRE-type damage)
